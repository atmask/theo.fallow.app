[{"content":"Material Intro to the Hebrew Bible: Lecture 7\nThe Nature of the Bible Inspiration Origins of the Premise A very common attribution to the Scriptures that the church holds to is the premise of inspiration. Inspiration is a claim about the nature of the biblical texts. The meaning of this claim has had ongoing life in the history of the church and different traditions in different contexts and times have had varying understanings of what this means. It\u0026rsquo;s important to recognize that any understanding about the nature of the scriptures, especially as it pertains to their being \u0026ldquo;God-breathed\u0026rdquo;, is going to shape our expectation of what these texts are, how they communicate, their purpose, and their role in our lives. All to often the meaning of the claim that scripture is God-breathed is assumed without thoughtful reflection on the origins of the phrase. This can give us presumed expectations about the scriptures that create more problems than they help us navigate.\nThe premise of scripture as God-breathed emerges from 2 Timothy 3:16:\nBut you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them, and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God (theopneustos), and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work. 2 Tim. 3:16 (NKJV)\nTheopneustos is Paul\u0026rsquo;s word that acts as a type of meta-reflection on the nature of the scriptures. The underlying word is compound word that translates to the \u0026ldquo;breath of God\u0026rdquo;. Theopneustos is only used once in the entirety of the new testament in this passage by Paul. For Paul, theopneustos is form of theological shorthand that is packed with meaning and backstory. If we want to engage with an understanding of what Paul means by this word it\u0026rsquo;s important that we engage with his understanding God\u0026rsquo;s divine breath at work in the world.\nModels of Inspirations As we mentioned at the outset, there are and have been different models for understanding the process of inspiration. This process by which humans, under the guidance of God\u0026rsquo;s spirit craft a text that speaks what God wants his people to hear1.\nTo one extreme there is a common view, which hopefully not framed too pejoartively, can be called the Golden Tablets from Heaven View. And this view assumes, that in order for the scriptures to speak a divine word (i.e. to speak in a divine capacity) it needs to have bypassed human involvement. The conception of this view tends to be of a bibical author falling under the power of Spirit which works through them to produce the text in a way that independent of the personality, experiences, character, tics, and faculties of that individual. If we look closely though at how the biblical author\u0026rsquo;s themselve portay their experience of working in partnership with God\u0026rsquo;s spirit (as we will) see see that this isn\u0026rsquo;t the case.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to note that this point is not made to bash a certain view of inspiration. But to face that view, refelct on it, and the implication that it has, and importanrly the background that informs this view. This was largely the bpersepctive of the scriptures in the community in which I came to faith myself and so I have an appreciation that this view aims to uphold view of the scripture that they believe preserves God\u0026rsquo;s involvement and the integrity of divine authorship. However, if you hold that expectation, it\u0026rsquo;s important to ask the question whether that expection is one which the bible holds for itself.\nThe reality of the\nthe process of the bible coming together is very complex. Their is history of interactions with changes to the manuscript that is incredibly human When people are under the spirit they are in control of themselves The challenge over time as you come an understanding of the making of the bible leads to an understanding of a cannon that is shaped over time.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at moments when the authors mention their own biblcal writing and what we\u0026rsquo;ll notice is that it\u0026rsquo;s mundace/normal. IT should n\u0026rsquo;t frighten us but encourage us to challenge our assumptions\nBiblical Representations of Inspiration The Scriptures that Paul refers to in 1 Timothy 3:16 are the Jewish Scriptures, what now refer to as our old testament. These scriptures are full of places where the authors themselves write about the experience of having God\u0026rsquo;s spirit at work in them.\nExamples of people understanding themselves under th influence of God\u0026rsquo;s spirit but with control of their facultires (beautiful poetic form and narrtive form) Micah 3:8 2 Samuel 23:1-2\nUnpacking the Assumptions of our Cultural Moment One our first big challenges that we must face when we come to the scriptures is due that fact that, for us , in hte west we are 2 centuries into a modern secular tradition that sees a firm spearation between the divine and the human, the heavenly and earthly, the spiritual, and the physical. For the most part, if some one beleives that hte divine exists, the cultural assumption is that it is a realm that is separate and isolated freom our daily physical realm. However, sometimes God and the heavenly realm will invade/intervene our natural world and we call it miracles/supernatural. The deep assumption, going back to philospgers from centruires ago is that God insturments that physical world and then retreats to his own realm with occasional intervention. Now, 200 years later people don\u0026rsquo;t have an experience of the divine and so they question at all whether this realm even exists.\nThe problems is, this model is only around 200 years old. Before then, the natrual and supernatural were not considered distinct but were deeply intertwined. God pushed the sun up every morning and that was natural. It was an enchanted view of the world not bounded by what we could see and test. The problem we often have now, is that we plug the bible into this modern model and create all kinds of problems for ourselves. Problems that relate to understanding what it is and how it speaks, and our expectations for it. Practically, what happnes is that we want to uphold a high view of scripture as we feel forced to defend it as one of these supernatural interventions and so then it becomes important to defend and explain that it came into existence through supernatural means that cannot be explained through normal human processes, because if that\u0026rsquo;s what happned then the bible is simply a natrual document.\nRe-shaping our Notion of Divine-Human Partnership Now, do the biblical authors share this view of reality? This view of the relationship between the heavenly and the earthly.\nFrom page one of the bible, we are presented with a view that believes in multiple domensions to reality, of the heavenly and earthly.\nThe whole nature of the garden of eden and the image of God is that humans are the place heavenly and the earthly, the dvine and the human are one. Rhe entrie image of Eden, in which God walks with humanity and humanity is atuned to the sound of God\u0026rsquo;s presence speaks to the vision of creation as a unified heaven and earth\nGen 1:26 God\u0026rsquo;s will is carried forward in and through humans who he has chosen to partner with in bringing blessing to creation. God\u0026rsquo;s interventions is through the natrual. He does create to override creation but work through his human partners in creation. [This is an important idea that we\u0026rsquo;ll return to when we look at the bible as narrative in a nother post]\nSo when it comes to our image of the bible and it\u0026rsquo;s origins, the work of the spirit in and through humans are moments in which the divine and the human are working partnership together. This is still something peopke can deny. But what this understanding opens up for us is the a wider field of view in which we do not have to imagine the bible\u0026rsquo;s origins as being supernatural with little ot no human involvement or human context. And if God has chosen to work through humans this means that it is wrapped up in huanity and humans have cultures, and languages, we exist in a place in time, we are finite and out contextx change over time. This shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be somethign we shy away from but view as an invitation to meet the biblical authors where they are and in their understanding.\nThe assumption of the biblical authors however is that through the image of God in humans, that we are the place where heaven and earth meet. The view of Eden as a whole\nEvery human you encounter is a concrete embodiemtn of the creator. Not every concrete embodiment is intune with the creato (Gen 9:1-7). All the people you meet in this story are physical creatures through whom God\u0026rsquo;s will is at work in the world. When applied to the origins of the bible, what it measn, then, is that this will have a traceable human history.\nEverything that takes place in God\u0026rsquo;s creation in is graced with the presence of God, is held together, for, declaring the glory of. - student\nThe human history of the bible is the divine hisotry. When we talk about hte human author we also talk about hte divine author. The divine author in lovae andrelationship with people who had an understanding in a place and time\nWhat all of this means is that inspiration get removed from the list of things we can use to try to convince someone of anything. It makes it a faith claim and the apostle accept with the belief that this story points to a person (25:00) and attests to the resurrection. We don\u0026rsquo;t need to try and show how the bible ought to compel. Instead show the bible, show the story and show how it leads to Jesus. The life of Jesus is what compels.\nOld model: Defend the bible\u0026rsquo;s authority and then talk about Jesus. New: Allow Jesus to compel people\nNot true because it is authoritatvie, authoritative because it leads to truth. Authroitative does not mean it tells us what to do.\nThis emerges out of the enlightenment period. As the scientific process began to categeorize the natural world, faith based communities felt the need to defend that which began to seem counter to the scientific process. Rather than seeing God in step with the natural world the category fo supernatural was developed.\nWhat Does a Text Do? Iluustrated epxressions of the idea of paradox. In relation ot the bible it is a good picture of complex causality. That there are things which seems to have as their origin and source another thing that also seems to be part of it\u0026rsquo;s origin and source.\nThese texts would not exist without the coveneant people of God. The covenant people of God would not exist without these texts.\nTwo notions of the inspirations\nHow the authors were impressed upon by an understanding of God acting in the world given by the spirit (how God spoke) Captures how God spoke pinned to a moment in time How God speaks now. The Spirit working out through our engagement with the text Inspriation is not just in the formation of the text but also in the interpretation of it. We reject that which is not from the spirit\nIt\u0026rsquo;s how God spoke at one time revealing himself to a people in a time and place but it is not how he speaks to us now?\nWe can disagree with the meaning of what they say while bilieving the significance of that meaning in their context\nE.D. Hirsch: Validity in Interpretation Their are theories of literature that question if meaning can be ascribed to a text. More is the assumption that meaning is in the eye of the beholder. Hirsch, yes we don\u0026rsquo;t often listen to each other. But when someone writes an act of communication, the meant something by it. And using tools we can work to understand what they meant to communicate.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s understanding the meaning of what they are saying. However, meaning is tied to a place in time and context. Meaing refers to what someone intended. It is locked in history, in a language, culture and context. But there is a significance to what they say in relation to their context that transcends their moment in history. They speak to human condition that rise above the limitations of their period in tume. Significanerefers to the ongoing communication life of a text.\nThe holy spirit is not limited to the audience that first that communication. The Holy Spirit, as Jesus said in the upper room discourse will continue to guide us into truth and reveal new things.\nSo the holy spirit is at work in the significane of the text. God works as the voice behind the voice. For Time the holy spirit must connect our understanfinf to what the original author meant. I wonder if I agree. Perhaps, the spirit means we read it through the lens of Jesus\n1 Cor 15:58 Our labours guided by the spirit are not in vain. They are contributions and investments in the new resurrection of Creation. They are partnerships with God.\nThe gospel is a unique instance of this that speaks to their experience of the Jesus story.\nAnd so what we create can contribute to pointing to that story. But it\u0026rsquo;s in our context. The gospels are unique in that they are where we go to know Jesus and they unfold on our understanding of everything else\nI think Tim inserts too much into the definition of inspiration here. This definition gets close to assuming that the scriptures are God\u0026rsquo;s way of communicating timeless truth to his people. Perhaps it would be better to say that the Spirit guides people to reveal significance about God incarnate in the context of their time, culture, and language.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/notes/bp-inspiration/","summary":"Material Intro to the Hebrew Bible: Lecture 7\nThe Nature of the Bible Inspiration Origins of the Premise A very common attribution to the Scriptures that the church holds to is the premise of inspiration.

And rather than coming to the scriptures and trying to put that expection it, and expectation which the biblical authors did not have as they wrote the text is going to create problems for us. We can, however, take the approach of looking at what the scriptures say for themselve about the formation of the scriptures, their assembly, and how the spirit works alongside the writers. If we take a step back from what we think we know, we can even take a closer look at how the bible works. Paul does not tell timothy, the bible is inspired and therefore, it is always historically accurate, or that it is inspired nad therefore revelas timeless truth about God. What Paul does tell Timothy is that the scriptures are inspired and profitable for instructing us and making us wise is such a way that we are led to faith in Christ.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s important. Something I really want to key off of there is the notion of bedoming wise. Wisdom is not about attaining facts. Wisdom is about human maturity, meditation, questioning, and discernment. The path of becoming wise is a pligramage that we walk. A road that we travel but a journey that forms us as well.\nSo like Jacob, you\u0026rsquo;re invited to wrestle, like Moses, force your view of God to repent,\nIt\u0026rsquo;s how they thought about God in relation to their time. (Ex. Abraham\u0026hellip;.not abot Abraham\u0026rsquo;s willingness to kill his son. That is never commended. His faith in the character of God is comended. Nobody was suprised to hear a god ask for child sacrafice. The story of this author however is about the fact that this God doesn\u0026rsquo;t need your scarafice. He provides what you need for relationship.) And some would demand, well what about the levitical system. And I would sugges that this is excalty the same. God does not need these sacrafices. We do. The author of Hebrews tells us that sacrafice is for the cleansing of our conscience. The notion that sacrafice systematically alters how God feels about you is pagan magic. It is an attempt at coercion of God. But we have to God who will not be coerced. The story\nMy bible can\u0026rsquo;t say that.\nWhy? Why does inspiration have to preclude the limitations of the people. cultures, and times in which it was written. This does not make the bible relative. It does not mean you get to pick and choose. It does mean that revelation is the work of the Spirit. It does mean that we need to let go of certainty and trust that God can teach truth in each life personally. It is scary because it means we cannot proof-text eachother. It is scary because it means that knowing God is tied to spiritual maturity and not head knowledge. You cannot control a church that way. You cannot create an oeganization that fluid. But God doesn\u0026rsquo;t require that of us. He is the head that guides each part.

I hope to write with humility and with the aim of unity among those who love and follow Christ. In writing, I want to address and challenge what now seem to be several default settings in the West for viewing the scriptures. In particular, I want to looks at the nature of truth of in the sctiptures, the intention of the scriptures, and the nature of inspiration. I would like to do this be reframing several stories back into their ancient context to see how doing so improves our understanding of God, upholds his character, and does not diminish our view of the scriptures. It is my hope that by seeing the values of challenging our default assmptions when it comes to the above that we would be more open to dawning a new pair of glasses when we encounter God i the scriptures. One that upholds his goodness, is consistent with the revelation of Yahweh in Christ, and one that asks more of us as readers.\nNote: I will use the scriptures or Hebrew bible as I write to refer to what we commonly call the Old testament. First, I do this because I do not want to create a chasm between the two. I want to recognize that the Hebrew scrptures are not just our old testament but a rich well for the Jewish tradiiton today and the very scriptures which we beleive culminate in Christ. Second, I do this because that is the relationship and language that Jesus and the early church maintined when speaking of the Hebrew scriptures.\nWhy Do We Care? When I was a Kid I had this thick off-yellow, hardcover NIV illustrated Children\u0026rsquo;s bible. Every summer I took it back and forth to camp. I was aghast that people would use pens in their bible. This was after all the Bible. When I turned 12 I got home everyday and read from this bible for hours (That has to do with my obbsessive compulsive nature but is not an exaggeration). There was so much I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand. Some parts scared me and I tried to push them to the back of my mind, other parts filled me with relief and hope. When I first started going to youth group as a teenager this is the bible I showed up with. All I had.\nAs a teen I got one of those, thin-line leather ESV bibles. Having gotten over my\nBecause we love the scriptures. Because Christ knew and loved the scriptures. Because as\nUnpacking What We believe Before going further, I want to recognize why I\u0026rsquo;ve seen people react as they do to interpretations of the OT that challenge literal and flat readings of the text. Reading\u0026rsquo;s that try to acquit and attribute horrors done in the name of God to God. Often when friends get concerned it\u0026rsquo;s not because they want to defend their way of reading the text. They get concerned because they\u0026rsquo;ve grown up being taught and led to believe that that the only way to uphold the bible as being God-breathed and having authority by upholding a literal reading of the text. When this method of engaging with the scriptures is questioned then what they truly want to defend also feels threatned. They are often not equipped with the tools and to change their perspective and to compound it all, the search for new perspective flowing out of a desire to understnad the scriptures, the willingness to be uncertain enough about what has been handed down to you that you would consider putting it into the furnace and against the anvil is considered a show of doubt and instability in faith.\nMany of us in the west have been handed down a chirstian tradition that has tried to answer so many questions according to a deeply embedded assumption. We no longer even see these assumptions because we now take them for granted and we are distracted trying to answer questions accroding to these assumptions. The common underlying assumption in the west is that the Bible mediates truth through a literal recounting of facts. And these facts instruct us, about how to live, how to be moral, and the character of God. In our mind, the only fitting view for the scriptures as a religious text is as a didactic moral text. We have tried to push this view so far that we attempt to harmonize the mult-vocal biblica narritives into one contradiciton-less uniform voice. We have pushed so far as to adopt a doctrine of perspicuity which claims that the bible is clear and understandable. Do we not see an irony that GotQuestions, an website entirely devoted to trying to answer questions about the bible from a reformed point of view also holds this beleif.\nThe bible is a religious text. Religious texts are conclusive. The present clear moral guidelines. They are unambiguous (though maybe cofngusing). They are didactic and aim to teach us through.\nInvitations to Doubt If we can recognize that then let\u0026rsquo;s also recognize the following. That is is a deeply rooted faith in the goodness of our heavenly father that allows us to challenge anything that we think is not befitting the goodness we believe about him. That we do not defend the truth; the truth defends us. The bible is not true because it is authoritative; it is authoritative because it true.\nA Note on Marcionism Now, some may remain skeptical. You can hear the fundamentalist whisper from the wings \u0026ldquo;Marcionite Heresy\u0026rdquo;. For those who aren\u0026rsquo;t familiar with the MArcionite heresy here is the background. Marcion was an ealry member of the church who wrestled with the old testament stories of violence, sotries of divine violence, divine commanded violence, dinvely sanctioned violence. Facing this issue, Marcion asserted that the god of the old testametn was a different god than we see in the new testament. A different being then the god we know revealed in the person of Christ.\nThe early church declared this a heresy. The creeds we carry today assert along with the scriptures that there is one God and Father of all, maker of heaven and earth. But here\u0026rsquo;s the thing. The early church addressed a metaphysical approach to understanding old testament violence. It is true that the Jewish Scriptures which we know as the old testament tell the unracveling story of a people\u0026rsquo;s relationship with God and as Christian we beleive this culminates in the person of Christ, God With Us. We do not beleive as Marcion did that the Gold of the old testament is different than that ofthe new testament. However, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean we don\u0026rsquo;t still wrestle with violent depcitions of God in the hebrew sciptures. What it does is shift the way we wrestle with these tests away from a metaphysical issue to a hermneutical issue. This invitation isn\u0026rsquo;t an invitation to throw out the jewish scriptures. It\u0026rsquo;s an invitation to challenge the way we understand the ways in which they communicate truth, how it\u0026rsquo;s autohrity is mediated into our lives, and what the diving human partnership of God\u0026rsquo;s own Spirit at work in humans (in-spiriting) means. (richard beck)\nThe thing is this. Marcionism is a metaphysical\nWhat is truth? \u0026ldquo;What is truth?\u0026rdquo;, the question rolled off of Pilate\u0026rsquo;s lips to the very one who is Truth. Truth is what we all seek. Perhaps, like Pilate, we feel like we live in an age in which we can question the very basis of truth. But truth is reality. What we call true are the things that corespond to reality. Truth is what we collide with when we are untrue and live out untruth.\nIf we read the scriptures with a high-view then believe they mediate truth. However, an important question to ask is what is the nature of the way that it communicates truth. To clarify let me give an example.\nIn my teenage years I was part of a Christian tradition that adopted a literal reading of Genesis. Every fall we had apologetics retreats dedicated to proving how leading scienctist were wrong, that fossils were only 6000 years old, that creation was a six day process. We were encouraged to go out and challenge our science teachers and to save from fire our friends who were on the slippery slope of doubting the literal interpretation of the Genesis creation narrative.\nAnd so I want to end this section with a question we need to ask when we encounter the biblical narratives. What is the nature of the way that this is true?. My early tradiition taught me so many good things but also had many blindspots. It was a mistake to assume that what the biblical author of Genesis was:\ntrying to answer my questions in my context presenting a scientific view of origins In reali\nWho\u0026rsquo;s to say that\nReality, or that which corresponds to reality.
