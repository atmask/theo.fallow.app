<p>&lsquo;When we come to to the bible expecting it to be an instructional manual intended by God to give us unwavering, cement hard certainty about our faith, we are actually creating problems for ourselves, beacues - as we I&rsquo;ve come to see - the Bible <em>wasn&rsquo;t designed to meet that expectation</em>. In other words, the &ldquo;problems&rdquo; we encounter when reading the Bible are really problems we create for ourselves when we harbor the misguided expectation that the Bible is designed primarily to provide clear answers&rsquo; - Pete Enns, How the Bible really Works</p>
<p>&lsquo;And all that stress about the Bible needing to provide certaintiy about God, life, and the universe is rich soil for cultivating a defensive attitude about our beliefs and therefore an angry and comabtive posture towards those who see things differntly&rsquo; - ibid.</p>
<p>I want to compare the two ways of reading the bible. To see which brings us closer to Jesus and deeper life. The scriptures are not about what they claim but about what those claims in their context tell us about God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These three characterisitcs - <em>ancient, ambiguous</em> and <em>diverse</em>- are not rough patches along the way that we need to &ldquo;deal with&rdquo;, so we can get on with the important matter of reading the Bible properly. They are, rather, what make the Bible <em>worth reading at all</em>. - Ibid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bible is not true because it is authoritative, The bible is authoritative because it is true&rdquo; But in what form does it communicate truth.</p>

<p>After a recent conversation with friends, I decided to write an overview of where I currently am with how we approach what we refer to as our Old Testament. I hope to write with humility and with the aim of unity among those who love and follow Christ. In writing, I want to address and challenge what now seem to be several default settings in the West for viewing the scriptures. In particular, I want to looks at the nature of truth of in the sctiptures, the intention of the scriptures, and the nature of inspiration. I would like to do this be reframing several stories back into their ancient context to see how doing so improves our understanding of God, upholds his character, and does not diminish our view of the scriptures. It is my hope that by seeing the values of challenging our default assmptions when it comes to the above that we would be more open to dawning a new pair of glasses when we encounter God i the scriptures. One that upholds his goodness, is consistent with the revelation of Yahweh in Christ, and one that asks more of us as readers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note:</em> I will use <em>the scriptures</em> or <em>Hebrew bible</em> as I write to refer to what we commonly call the Old testament. First, I do this because I do not want to create a chasm between the two. I want to recognize that the Hebrew scrptures are not just our old testament but a rich well for the Jewish tradiiton today and the very scriptures which we beleive culminate in Christ. Second, I do this because that is the relationship and language that Jesus and the early church maintined when speaking of the Hebrew scriptures.</p>

<p>When I was a Kid I had this <em>thick</em> off-yellow, hardcover NIV illustrated Children&rsquo;s bible. Every summer I took it back and forth to camp. I was aghast that people would use pens in their bible. This was after all <em>the Bible</em>. When I turned 12 I got home everyday and read from this bible for hours (That has to do with my obbsessive compulsive nature but is not an exaggeration). There was so much I didn&rsquo;t understand. Some parts scared me and I tried to push them to the back of my mind, other parts filled me with relief and hope. When I first started going to youth group as a teenager this is the bible I showed up with. All I had.</p>
<p>As a teen I got one of those, thin-line leather ESV bibles. Having gotten over my</p>

<h1 id="unpacking-what-we-believe">Unpacking What We believe<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#unpacking-what-we-believe">#</a></h1>
<p>Before going further, I want to recognize why I&rsquo;ve seen people react as they do to interpretations of the OT that challenge literal and flat readings of the text. Reading&rsquo;s that try to acquit and attribute horrors done in the name of God to God. Often when friends get concerned it&rsquo;s not because they want to defend their way of reading the text. They get concerned because they&rsquo;ve grown up being taught and led to believe that that the only way to uphold the bible as being God-breathed and having authority by upholding a literal reading of the text. When this method of engaging with the scriptures is questioned then what they truly want to defend also feels threatned. They are often not equipped with the tools and to change their perspective and to compound it all, the search for new perspective flowing out of a desire to understnad the scriptures, the willingness to be uncertain enough about what has been handed down to you that you would consider putting it into the furnace and against the anvil is considered a show of doubt and instability in faith.</p>
<p>Many of us in the west have been handed down a chirstian tradition that has tried to answer so many questions according to a deeply embedded assumption. We no longer even see these assumptions because we now take them for granted and we are distracted trying to answer questions accroding to these assumptions. The common underlying assumption in the west is that the Bible mediates truth through a literal recounting of facts. And these facts instruct us, about how to live, how to be moral, and the character of God. In our mind, the only fitting view for the scriptures as a religious text is as a didactic moral text. We have tried to push this view so far that we attempt to harmonize the mult-vocal biblica narritives into one contradiciton-less uniform voice. We have pushed so far as to adopt a doctrine of perspicuity which claims that the bible is clear and understandable. Do we not see an irony that GotQuestions, an website entirely devoted to trying to answer questions about the bible from a reformed point of view also holds this beleif.</p>
<p>The bible is a religious text. Religious texts are conclusive. The present clear moral guidelines. They are unambiguous (though maybe cofngusing). They are didactic and aim to teach us through.</p>
<h1 id="invitations-to-doubt">Invitations to Doubt<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#invitations-to-doubt">#</a></h1>
<p>If we can recognize that then let&rsquo;s also recognize the following. That is is a deeply rooted faith in the goodness of our heavenly father that allows us to challenge anything that we think is not befitting the goodness we believe about him. That we do not defend the truth; the truth defends us. The bible is not true because it is authoritative; it is authoritative because it true.</p>
<h2 id="a-note-on-marcionism">A Note on Marcionism<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-note-on-marcionism">#</a></h2>
<p>Now, some may remain skeptical. You can hear the fundamentalist whisper from the wings &ldquo;Marcionite Heresy&rdquo;. For those who aren&rsquo;t familiar with the MArcionite heresy here is the background. Marcion was an ealry member of the church who wrestled with the old testament stories of violence, sotries of divine violence, divine commanded violence, dinvely sanctioned violence. Facing this issue, Marcion asserted that the god of the old testametn was a different god than we see in the new testament. A different being then the god we know revealed in the person of Christ.</p>
<p>The early church declared this a heresy. The creeds we carry today assert along with the scriptures that there is one God and Father of all, maker of heaven and earth. But here&rsquo;s the thing. The early church addressed a metaphysical approach to understanding old testament violence. It is true that the Jewish Scriptures which we know as the old testament tell the unracveling story of a people&rsquo;s relationship with God and as Christian we beleive this culminates in the person of Christ, God With Us. We do not beleive as Marcion did that the Gold of the old testament is different than that ofthe new testament. However, that doesn&rsquo;t mean we don&rsquo;t still wrestle with violent depcitions of God in the hebrew sciptures. What it does is shift the way we wrestle with these tests away from a metaphysical issue to a hermneutical issue. This invitation isn&rsquo;t an invitation to throw out the jewish scriptures. It&rsquo;s an invitation to challenge the way we understand the ways in which they communicate truth, how it&rsquo;s autohrity is mediated into our lives, and what the diving human partnership of God&rsquo;s own Spirit at work in humans (in-spiriting) means. (richard beck)</p>
<p>The thing is this. Marcionism is a metaphysical</p>
<h1 id="what-is-truth">What is truth?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-is-truth">#</a></h1>
<p>&ldquo;What is truth?&rdquo;, the question rolled off of Pilate&rsquo;s lips to the very one who is Truth. Truth is what we all seek. Perhaps, like Pilate, we feel like we live in an age in which we can question the very basis of truth. But truth is reality. What we call true are the things that corespond to reality. Truth is what we collide with when we are untrue and live out untruth.</p>
<p>If we read the scriptures with a high-view then believe they mediate truth. However, an important question to ask is <em>what is the nature of the way that it communicates truth</em>. To clarify let me give an example.</p>
<p>In my teenage years I was part of a Christian tradition that adopted a literal reading of Genesis. Every fall we had apologetics retreats dedicated to proving how leading scienctist were wrong, that fossils were only 6000 years old, that creation was a six day process. We were encouraged to go out and challenge our science teachers and to save from fire our friends who were on the slippery slope of doubting the literal interpretation of the Genesis creation narrative.</p>
<p>And so I want to end this section with a question we need to ask when we encounter the biblical narratives. <em>What is the nature of the way that this is true?</em>. My early tradiition taught me so many good things but also had many blindspots. It was a mistake to assume that what the biblical author of Genesis was:</p>
<ul>
<li>trying to answer my questions in my context</li>
<li>presenting a scientific view of origins</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>In reali</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s to say that</p>
<p>Reality, or that which corresponds to reality. Reality what we run into when we go wrong.</p>
