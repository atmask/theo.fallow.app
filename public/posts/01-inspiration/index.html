I want to press into the questions that trouble a lot of people and to bring those into focus. I want to bring those notions and assumption into the light and question them. And I want to suggest an alternative lens for understanding inspiration</p>
<p>Thesis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inspiration does not divorce the scriptures from their context</li>
<li>Inspritation does not mean the bible works by conveying timeless truth</li>
<li>Inspiration does tie the bible to God&rsquo;s purpose for human partnership and growth</li>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WV9uFZA9EYY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WV9uFZA9EYY</a></p>
<p><em>Having inspiration not mean &ldquo;inerrancy&rdquo; &ldquo;infalliability&rdquo; is only a problem if we&rsquo;ve already been handed an assumption that that is in fact what it means</em>. And rather than coming to the scriptures and trying to put that expection it, and expectation which the biblical authors did not have as they wrote the text is going to create problems for us. We can, however, take the approach of looking at what the scriptures say for themselve about the formation of the scriptures, their assembly, and how the spirit works alongside the writers. If we take a step back from what we think we know, we can even take a closer look at how the bible works. Paul does not tell timothy, the bible is inspired and therefore, it is always historically accurate, or that it is inspired nad therefore revelas timeless truth about God. What Paul does tell Timothy is that the scriptures are inspired and profitable for instructing us and making us wise is such a way that we are led to faith in Christ.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s important. Something I really want to key off of there is the notion of bedoming wise. Wisdom is not about attaining facts. Wisdom is about human maturity, meditation, questioning, and discernment. The path of becoming wise is a pligramage that we walk. A road that we travel but a journey that forms us as well.</p>
<p>So like Jacob, you&rsquo;re invited to wrestle, like Moses, force your view of God to repent,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how they thought about God in relation to their time. (Ex. Abraham&hellip;.not abot Abraham&rsquo;s willingness to kill his son. That is never commended. His faith in the character of God is comended. Nobody was suprised to hear a god ask for child sacrafice. The story of this author however is about the fact that this God doesn&rsquo;t need your scarafice. He provides what you need for relationship.) And some would demand, well what about the levitical system. And I would sugges that this is excalty the same. God does not need these sacrafices. We do. The author of Hebrews tells us that sacrafice is for the cleansing of our conscience. The notion that sacrafice systematically alters how God feels about you is pagan magic. It is an attempt at coercion of God. But we have to God who will not be coerced. The story</p>
<p>My bible can&rsquo;t say that.</p>
<p>Why? Why does inspiration have to preclude the limitations of the people. cultures, and times in which it was written. This does not make the bible relative. It does not mean you get to pick and choose. It does mean that revelation is the work of the Spirit. It does mean that we need to let go of certainty and trust that God can teach truth in each life personally. It is scary because it means we cannot proof-text eachother. It is scary because it means that knowing God is tied to spiritual maturity and not head knowledge. You cannot control a church that way. You cannot create an oeganization that fluid. But God doesn&rsquo;t require that of us. He is the head that guides each part. And we have the fullness of God revealed in Christ against which we measure all things.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at texts where there is meta-refelction on the nature of the scriptures</p>
<p>2 Tim 3:16 -&gt; Reflection on the nature of the scriptures [God-breathed/Inspired]
Theological short-hand
Paked with meaning and back-story</p>
<p>Examples of people understanding themselves under th influence of God&rsquo;s spirit but with control of their facultires (beautiful poetic form and narrtive form)
Micah 3:8
2 Samuel 23:1-2</p>
<p>There are different models for how people understand this taking place. This being the proces of God&rsquo;s spirit working with people to produce texts for God&rsquo;s people to hear. How a human under the guidance of God&rsquo;s spirit craft a text that speak what God want&rsquo;s his people to hear</p>
<p>What are our views:</p>
<ul>
<li>one extreme: Golden tablets falling from heaven: For the bilbe to speak a divine word&hellip; it neeeds to have bypassed human involvement (my understanding in the community in which I came to faith)</li>
<li>the process of the bible coming together is very complex. Their is history of interactions with changes to the manuscript that is incredibly human</li>
<li>When people are under the spirit they are in control of themselves</li>
</ul>
<p>The challenge over time as you come an understanding of the making of the bible leads to an understanding of a cannon that is shaped over time.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at moments when the authors mention their own biblcal writing and what we&rsquo;ll notice is that it&rsquo;s mundace/normal. IT should n&rsquo;t frighten us but encourage us to challenge our assumptions</p>
<p>One our first big challenges that we must face when we come to the scriptures is due that fact that, for us , in hte west we are 2 centuries into a modern secular tradition that sees a firm spearation between the divine and the human, the heavenly and earthly, the spiritual, and the physical. For the most part, if some one beleives that hte divine exists, the cultural assumption is that it is a realm that is separate and isolated freom our daily physical realm. However, sometimes God and the heavenly realm will invade/intervene our natural world and we call it miracles/supernatural. The deep assumption, going back to philospgers from centruires ago is that God insturments that physical world and then retreats to his own realm with occasional intervention. Now, 200 years later people don&rsquo;t have an experience of the divine and so they question at all whether this realm even exists.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="./images/supernatural.png" alt="img"  />
</p>
<p>The problems is, this model is only around 200 years old. Before then, the natrual and supernatural were not considered distinct but were deeply intertwined. God pushed the sun up every morning and that was natural. It was an enchanted view of the world not bounded by what we could see and test. The problem we often have now, is that we plug the bible into this modern model and create all kinds of problems for ourselves. Problems that relate to understanding what it is and how it speaks, and our expectations for it. Practically, what happnes is that we want to uphold a high view of scripture as we feel forced to defend it as one of these supernatural interventions and so then it becomes important to defend and explain that it came into existence through supernatural means that cannot be explained through normal human processes, because if that&rsquo;s what happned then the bible is simply a natrual document.</p>
<p>Now, do the biblical authors share this view of reality? This view of the relationship between the heavenly and the earthly.</p>
<p>From page one of the bible, we are presented with a view that believes in multiple domensions to reality, of the heavenly and earthly.</p>
<p>The whole nature of the garden of eden and the image of God is that humans are the place heavenly and the earthly, the dvine and the human are one. Rhe entrie image of Eden, in which God walks with humanity and humanity is atuned to the sound of God&rsquo;s presence speaks to the vision of creation as a unified heaven and earth</p>
<p>Gen 1:26
God&rsquo;s will is carried forward in and through humans who he has chosen to partner with in bringing blessing to creation. God&rsquo;s interventions is through the natrual. He does create to override creation but work through his human partners in creation. [This is an important idea that we&rsquo;ll return to when we look at the bible as narrative in a nother post]</p>
<p>So when it comes to our image of the bible and it&rsquo;s origins, the work of the spirit in and through humans are moments in which the divine and the human are working partnership together. This is still something peopke can deny. But what this understanding opens up for us is the a wider field of view in which we do not have to imagine the bible&rsquo;s origins as being supernatural with little ot no human involvement or human context. And if God has chosen to work through humans this means that it is wrapped up in huanity and humans have cultures, and languages, we exist in a place in time, we are finite and out contextx change over time. This shouldn&rsquo;t be somethign we shy away from but view as an invitation to meet the biblical authors where they are and in their understanding.</p>
<p>The assumption of the biblical authors however is that through the image of God in humans, that we are the place where heaven and earth meet. The view of Eden as a whole</p>
<p>Every human you encounter is a concrete embodiemtn of the creator. Not every concrete embodiment is intune with the creato (Gen 9:1-7). All the people you meet in this story are physical creatures through whom God&rsquo;s will is at work in the world.
When applied to the origins of the bible, what it measn, then, is that this will have a traceable human history.</p>
<p>Everything that takes place in God&rsquo;s creation in is graced with the presence of God, is held together, for, declaring the glory of. - student</p>
<p>The human history of the bible is the divine hisotry. When we talk about hte human author we also talk about hte divine author. The divine author in lovae andrelationship with people who had an understanding in a place and time</p>
<p>What all of this means is that inspiration get removed from the list of things we can use to try to convince someone of anything. It makes it a faith claim and the apostle accept with the belief that this story points to a person (25:00) and attests to the resurrection. We don&rsquo;t need to try and show how the bible ought to compel. Instead show the bible, show the story and show how it leads to Jesus. The life of Jesus is what compels.</p>
<p>Old model: Defend the bible&rsquo;s authority and then talk about Jesus.
New: Allow Jesus to compel people</p>
<p>Not true because it is authoritatvie, authoritative because it leads to truth. Authroitative does not mean it tells us what to do.</p>
<p>This emerges out of the enlightenment period. As the scientific process began to categeorize the natural world, faith based communities felt the need to defend that which began to seem counter to the scientific process. Rather than seeing God in step with the natural world the category fo supernatural was developed.</p>
<p>Inspriation is not just in the formation of the text but also in the interpretation of it. We reject that which is not from the spirit</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how God spoke at one time revealing himself to a people in a time and place but it is not how he speaks to us now?</p>
<p>We can disagree with the meaning of what they say while bilieving the significance of that meaning in their context</p>
