I do not mean to start this post aggressively but thoughtfully. I want to confront head on what the commonly accepted notions of inspiration mean for us today. I want to press into the questions that trouble a lot of people and to bring those into focus. I want to bring those notions and assumption into the light and question them. And I want to suggest an alternative lens for understanding inspiration 


Thesis: 
- Inspiration does not divorce the scriptures from their context
- Inspritation does not mean the bible works by conveying timeless truth
- Inspiration does tie the bible to God's purpose for human partnership and growth

## But How can the bible be Inspired if...?

*Having inspiration not mean "inerrancy" "infalliability" is only a problem if we've already been handed an assumption that that is in fact what it means*. And rather than coming to the scriptures and trying to put that expection it, and expectation which the biblical authors did not have as they wrote the text is going to create problems for us. We can, however, take the approach of looking at what the scriptures say for themselve about the formation of the scriptures, their assembly, and how the spirit works alongside the writers. If we take a step back from what we think we know, we can even take a closer look at how the bible works. Paul does not tell timothy, the bible is inspired and therefore, it is always historically accurate, or that it is inspired nad therefore revelas timeless truth about God. What Paul does tell Timothy is that the scriptures are inspired and profitable for instructing us and making us wise is such a way that we are led to faith in Christ. 

And that's important. Something I really want to key off of there is the notion of bedoming wise. Wisdom is not about attaining facts. Wisdom is about human maturity, meditation, questioning, and discernment. The path of becoming wise is a pligramage that we walk. A road that we travel but a journey that forms us as well. 

So like Jacob, you're invited to wrestle, like Moses, force your view of God to repent, 

It's how they thought about God in relation to their time. (Ex. Abraham....not abot Abraham's willingness to kill his son. That is never commended. His faith in the character of God is comended. Nobody was suprised to hear a god ask for child sacrafice. The story of this author however is about the fact that this God doesn't need your scarafice. He provides what you need for relationship.) And some would demand, well what about the levitical system. And I would sugges that this is excalty the same. God does not need these sacrafices. We do. The author of Hebrews tells us that sacrafice is for the cleansing of our conscience. The notion that sacrafice systematically alters how God feels about you is pagan magic. It is an attempt at coercion of God. But we have to God who will not be coerced. The story 

My bible can't say that.

Why? Why does inspiration have to preclude the limitations of the people. cultures, and times in which it was written. This does not make the bible relative. It does not mean you get to pick and choose. It does mean that revelation is the work of the Spirit. It does mean that we need to let go of certainty and trust that God can teach truth in each life personally. It is scary because it means we cannot proof-text eachother. It is scary because it means that knowing God is tied to spiritual maturity and not head knowledge. You cannot control a church that way. You cannot create an oeganization that fluid. But God doesn't require that of us. He is the head that guides each part. And we have the fullness of God revealed in Christ against which we measure all things.
