I do not mean to start this post aggressively but thoughtfully. I want to confront head on what the commonly accepted notions of inspiration mean for us today. I want to press into the questions that trouble a lot of people and to bring those into focus. I want to bring those notions and assumption into the light and question them. And I want to suggest an alternative lens for understanding inspiration 


Thesis: 
- Inspiration does not divorce the scriptures from their context
- Inspritation does not mean the bible works by conveying timeless truth
- Inspiration does tie the bible to God's purpose for human partnership and growth

## Outline

- Invitation: Walking the Emmaus Road
    - We are invited by Christ to a conversion of our imagination.
    - What are the central questions
    - There seem to be some central coping Mechanisms for the Bible: Good Intuitions Bad Assumptions
    - Wisdom literature and the pilgirmage
    - God is in no hurry. The process we take is part of his design.
    - Therapy: Coping Strategies for the Bible

- Inspiration: God is Breathing...And so Are You.

Divine Violence: God must work through people in time and history in order to save all people in time and history. 
Death is never the end for God's creation. God enters into creation as the vehicle of redemption through death suffered at the hands of humanity. He bears all the weight of every violence that we have perperated in himeself because he has never been above his own means in His need to redeem us from the verything killing us. No... this is still wrong and inconsistent with Jesus. Our God is not one of violent means.

But why? Why then and not earlier?
