What on earth is the Bible and what do we do with it? This question is one that opens up very big can or worms. It is a question which often goes unasked because of a certain sense of shame attached to it. Shame that you may be labelled




The Bible is a problem for a lot of people today. It's multiv

and so I want to address this. I want to look at and understand what the bible is and how it works. I want to consider the often unhelpful coping mechanisms we adopt for facilitating our relation ship to this book.


Excurses: Magic, Future, and Missing the Point

The year is 5005. You want to learn ancient magic from the 2000's. And so you purchase the best quality translated manuscripts you can from that age. As you go through the texts you find page upon pages of irrelevant details about London, Schools of magic, and acient wizards. However, you find the occassional spell. You memorize it, you walk up to a lock and with all your gusto you command "Alohomara". Nothing happens...and so, disenchanted by your unechanting purchase you leave the book to develop mold on the shelf. 

Now in this silly picture what if I told you that text was Harry Potter? We would all be on the same page that our future (primitive) descendant clearly missed. "It's not a book of magic!". But let's notice a few key things about the interaction in this story. First, *the expectation for this text to do one thing leaves our descendant filtering out large chunks of seemingly the irrlevant*. Second, 

Third, although their intuition was correct that this book was about magic, it was not about magic in the way that they thought. Because their expectation was not met for what this book should teach them they missed out on the real magic on offer in a narrative about loss, friendship, trials, and good enduring through evil.

Now if it is not already apparent, I'm talking about our relationship to the bible. Namely, that we good intuitions about what the bible is but often times we've made bad assumptions about how it works. These assumptions leave us in the best case skipping pages of detail that don't feel relevant and memorizing the good bits. In the worst case these assumptions leave us disenchanted when the world doesn't work in alighnment with what we though that this should tell us.

In short, we have treated the bible like a book of magic and lost the true magic of journeying with the authors in the .
In long we have treated the bible like divine handbook for being human and lost the life found in journeying as a human towards the divine with all of the mistakes, blindspots, failures, and triumphs that come with journey. We hav tried to bypas being human


What is your capacity to meet with God today? If you had to trust God's Spirit to lead you in writing for his church 
what would like that? Would you feel that it was good enough, or perfect enough? I certainly wouldn't. And somehow we hold a different view of the scriptures. We lift them up as timeless revelation of God. But they're not. They're the history of a faith community, written out by members of that community through time. It is masterful narrative with a deep understanding of the human psyche and reflection on the nature of the divine...and yet it belongs to a community in a time in place in which that reflection took place. It is not for all time.

In today's day and age we would not be discussing space and time had it not been for the thinking of einstein, and yet in his brilliance he could not see ahead to the discoveries that would be made (edison and the iphone). I think of something similar when I see Jesus and the new testament authors approach the Jewish scriptures. It is foundational that the Jesus movement of the first century emerges out of the deep rooted history of Judaism but that does not mean that their is not a foundational change that take place within the same movement. We cannot spend our time trying to defend the bible in order to make Jesus compelling, nor do we need to. The witness that the new testament authors give the Jewish scriptures is that they journey with us, making us wise to our need for rescue, making us wise through and understanding of our condition as people in this world. But the new testament authors, with their high regard for the jewish scriptures, do not view it as an end as does the hebrew bible internally. Paul and Jesus do not praise the torah as our source of meditation. Rather Jesus has come as the end to which the law pointed. Jesus is not the rejection of the torah but the reality of what it could not be or do. He is th fulness. He is the new wine that will not be held by old wineskins. Jesus is the one we listen to and meditate on. This is not the rejection of the law but the de-centring of it. The tanak is a pathway towards a house, it is a pathway that demarcates the human condition to its need for Jesus. And it does this with story.
