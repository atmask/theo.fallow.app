# How Jesus and the Apsotles Read Their Bibles

Jesus talks about the bible a lot. Never calls it the bible. The most common term is the writings but there are other titles as well

Luke 24 (Emmaus)
- What did the conversation fo v26,27 look like
- At the meal he does the same actions as the passover. As they take the bread from the risen Jesus their eyes are opened
- v33: Our hearts burned within us while we read the scriptures
- They recognized him in the breaking of the bread
- v44: Another bible study

- Jesus has a different experience with these texts than we have
- What he thinks they're about has differences and maybe some overlap with what our traditions have thought
- Twice, when jesus expresses the essence of the stroyline (not everything) he finds that it is about an annointed representative who go into death and suffering and out the side so that a whole new direction (repentance) and forgiveness (a new way of realting ot the creator) can out into all the cosmos and open for all the nations. It's for all people but begins with one people in a place and time

To Jesus it is so clear he would call them fools on the road that they do not see it.


2 Tim. 3:14-17
- knowing from whom you learned: The early Chritian communities are learning communities, they are communities where learning takes place in the context of relationships of confidence, trust, and intergenrational
- "sacred writings" -> The jewish scriptures
- The gospels are in formation mode but not arount yet
- What has he been taught?
    - The scriptures give you wisdom. Not just proverbs, eccls.
    - Wisdom that does what? That guides you to an end goal
    - Leads you to a point where you recognize that you need to be rescued. That God is willing to rescue and the basis for rescue is found in vision of the world rooted in Trust and confidence in God
    - Salvation: Need rescue
    - How? Through Faith
    - Wise to know that I need to be rescued by trusting in one outside of myself, the Christ, who is Jesus
    - We need an annointed rescuer outside of myself to sacve me. This is Jesus
    - The OT provides many portraits of annointed rescuers who fall short. And yet in Jesus we find the fulfillment of all that these others have outlined and pointed towards and intimated. (Adumbrate)

Let's take these at face value and seriosuly. What if we read this collection of wiritings and assume that this is what they're about. We work off of the foundation that what they have to say about right behaviour, about community, they do it by telling us the stroy that Jesus summarizes here.

There are lots of things we want the bible to do. And maybe some of them the Bible does. But we need to look at how it does them and come alongside it in that purpose.

Who produced these texts and for whom? The HB is minority report form ancient israel. Comes from a small group that believes they are preserving the meaning and the heritage of their history. The story tells us this and about the apostasy of the people.

Their are communities that foster a view about what these texts are about.

To understand how to read it we have to ask who's book is it? 

The Christian community throughout hist. has had diff coping strategies for dealing with these texts. Why did Jesus say it was about this and why do moder nchurches struggle to understand what it's about and pass it on to the younger generations. The Emmaus road stroy in which understanding is found Jesus breaking of the bread seems to imply this irony that we as a Christian community should have an understanding of this throughline heartbeat of the OT and yet we don't know what to do with it... why?

Jesus and his broken body were the spyhole through which the heartbeat of the scriptures were opened. That the warrior God represenations are transformed into the crucified Christ who defeats death

Emmaus is a movement from blindness to sight. Why are they blind? We seeit in their speech. Because they see Jesus' death as the neagtion of his identity as the annointed saviour. The breaking of hte bread is through what they see that it is prcesely through his life death and resurrection that he acts as the annointed one. This story is aobut hte conversion of their imagination and our previously held assumptions about these texts and how God works in the worls such that they find their fulfillment in Christ. There are certain lenses for these texts that will leave us blind. But the lens of Jesus is that we need one to go into death and suffering and through the other side for a new kind of ressurected life
