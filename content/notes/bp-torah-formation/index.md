# What the Torah Says About the Bible's Origins

Q: Where does the bible first mention the writing of the bible?
A: Exodus 17:8-9,14

...not very remarkable. But if you were there it feels pretty remarkable. Not destryed. So why is it written down? To remember. To remeber that God delivered us.

One of the fundamental purposes of the bible being created is to retell the story of how God is at work to rescue people.

### Second Mention
Exodus 19:1-6
- Invitation to a group of people to unique role as mediators of God to the nations
- Dependent on obedience

Exodus 24:3-8
- Writing of the bible (2nd mention)

### Third Mention

Deut 31:19, 21, 24-46
- Third mention
- Acknowledge the unfaithfulness of the people


## Roadmap

First Mention: Tell the story of how God is at work to rescue his people
Second Mention: God's invitation to the rescued people to be his representatives. The text acts as a covenental document
Third mention: The story of the rescued people's failure to live out their role in relationship and covenant and God's plan to rescue them and bless creation through a redeeming annointed one.


Fundamentally narrative but they function as inviations to covenant, but also accusation and pointer to future hope


We observer the ongoing development of the scriptures. Their is an observer of the formation. This is the redaction process.

Example: Little women..?
